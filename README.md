# dragg_pkg
Project 3

My package determines if the body depth of crabs are predicted by the sex of the crabs. To determine this assumption, my package provides access to an ANOVA table to show the statistics to test the prediction of body depth by sex, and a jitter plot to visually compare the relationship between the two characteristics. Included, is also a function to rename the body_depth column to a more descriptive name.


The functions included in my package are:

anova_crabs()

crab_col()

crab_plot()
